# data_flow_newton_raphson
This contains a folder structure downloaded from maxeler.mi.sanu.ac.rs WEBIDE.
Also in the root folder it contains the CPUCode and the Kernel Code.
This is based on the AddScalar project present in WEBIDE.
Just replacing the CPU Code and Kernel Code Should work.
WARNING: This is still a buggy code as the kernel needs control flow primitives to save the results
of one iteration and use it in the next
